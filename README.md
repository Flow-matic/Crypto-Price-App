# Crypto Price App

Cryptocurrency nowadays is in most demand and many people are investing in these currencies to get high returns. Many websites and applications provide us information about the rates of different cryptocurrencies availible in the crypto market. A crypto exchange API is a service to interface with cryptocurrency exchanges like [Binance.](https://www.binance.com/en) It allows users (either customers of the service or developers) to interface with cryptocurrency exchanges, execute trades, pull data, and receive data in real-time. 

This Project App was created using [Streamlit.](https://streamlit.io/)

Introduction to [Streamlit:](https://docs.streamlit.io/)



* Streamlit is an open-source python library for creating and sharing web apps for data science and machine learning projects. The library can help you create and deploy your data science solution with a few lines of code.

* Streamlit can seamlessly intergrate with other popular python libaries used in data science such as [Numpy,](https://numpy.org/) [Pandas,](https://pandas.pydata.org/) [Matplotlib,](https://matplotlib.org/) [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and many more.

* Streamlit uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a frontend framework to render the data on the screen.

* Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code. Streamlit makes it seamless to work on the interactive loop of coding and viewing results in the web app.

Streamlit cloud:
---

* Streamlit cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will deploy in only a few minutes.

* Streamlit Cloud is a workspace for your team to deploy, manage, and collaborate on your Streamlit apps. You connect your Streamlit Cloud account directly to your GitHub repository (public or private) and then Streamlit Cloud launches the apps directly from the code you've stored on GitHub. Most apps will launch in only a few minutes, and any time you update the code on GitHub, your app will automatically update for you. This creates a fast iteration cycle for your deployed apps, so that developers and viewers of apps can rapidly prototype, explore, and update apps.

* Under the hood Streamlit Cloud handles all of the containerization, authentication, scaling, security and everything else so that all you need to worry about is creating the app. Maintaining Streamlit apps is easy. Containers get the latest security patches, are actively monitored for container health.
